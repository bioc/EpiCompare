\usage{
EpiCompare(
  peakfiles,
  names,
  blacklist,
  picard = NULL,
  picard_names = NULL,
  reference = NULL,
  stat_plot = FALSE,
  save_output = FALSE,
  output_dir
)
}
\arguments{
\item{peakfiles}{A list of peak files as GRanges object. Files must be listed using `list()`}

\item{names}{A list of file names in the same order as the list of peak files.
Names must be specified using `c()`}

\item{blacklist}{A GRanges object containing blacklisted regions.}

\item{picard}{A list of summary metrics output from Picard.}

\item{picard_names}{A list of names in the same order as the list of Picard summary output.}

\item{reference}{A reference peak file as GRanges object.
If a reference is specified, it enables two analyses: (1) plot showing statistical significance of overlapping/non-overlapping peaks;
and (2) ChromHMM of overlapping/non-overlapping peaks}

\item{stat_plot}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, the function creates a plot showing the statistical significance of
overlapping/non-overlapping peaks. Reference peak file must be provided.}

\item{save_output}{Default FALSE. If TRUE, all outputs (tables and plots) of the analysis will be saved in a folder.}

\item{output_dir}{Path to where output HTML file should be saved.}
}
\value{
An HTML report
}
\description{
This function compares different epigenetic datasets and performs various functional analyses.
The function outputs an HTML report containing results from the analysis.
The report is mainly divided into three areas: (1) Peakfile information, (2) Overlapping peaks and (3) Functional annotations.
