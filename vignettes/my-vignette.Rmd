# Introduction

Load package and example datasets. The two example peakfiles have been 
```{r setup}
library(EpiCompare)
data("encode_H3K27ac")
data("CnT_H3K27ac")
```

The two example peakfiles have been transformed into GRanges object. 
If your peak files are in BED format, simply use `ChIPseeker::readPeakFile("/path/to/peak/file", as = "GRanges")`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
EpiCompare(peakfile1 = encode_H3K27ac,
           peakfile1_name = "encode",
           peakfile2 = CnT_H3K27ac,
           peakfile2_name = "CUT&Tag",
           outpath = "./EpiCompare.html")
```
