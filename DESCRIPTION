Description: EpiCompare is used to compare and analyse epigenetic datasets
    for quality control and benchmarking purposes.  The package outputs an
    HTML report consisting of three sections: (1. General metrics) Metrics
    on peaks (percentage of blacklisted and non-standard peaks, and peak
    widths) and fragments (duplication rate) of samples, (2. Peak overlap)
    Percentage and statistical significance of overlapping and
    non-overlapping peaks. Also includes upset plot and (3. Functional
    annotation) functional annotation (ChromHMM, ChIPseeker and enrichment
    analysis) of peaks.  Also includes peak enrichment around TSS.
