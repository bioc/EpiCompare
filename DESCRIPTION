Description: EpiCompare is used to compare and analyse epigenetic datasets for quality control and benchmarking purposes. The package outputs an HTML report consisting of three sections: (1. General metrics) Metrics on peaks (percentage of blacklisted and non-standard peaks, and peak widths) and fragments (duplication rate) of samples, (2. Peak overlap) Percetnage and statistical significance of overlapping and non-overlapping peaks. Also includes upset plot and (3. Functional annotation) functional annotation (ChromHMM, ChIPseeker and enrichment analysis) of peaks. Also includes peak enrichment around TSS.
