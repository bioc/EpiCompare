Description: EpiCompare is used to compare and analyse epigenetic datasets 
  for quality control and benchmarking purposes. 
  The package outputs an HTML report consisting of three sections: 
  (1. General metrics) Metrics on peaks (percentage of blacklisted and 
  non-standard peaks, and peak widths) and fragments (duplication rate) 
  of samples, 
  (2. Peak overlap) Percentage and statistical significance of 
  overlapping and non-overlapping peaks. Also includes upset plot and 
  (3. Functional annotation) functional annotation 
  (ChromHMM, ChIPseeker and enrichment analysis) of peaks. 
  Also includes peak enrichment around TSS.
