# Introduction 

`EpiCompare` is an R package for comparing different epigenetic datasets for quality control and benchmarking purposes. The function outputs a report in HTML format consisting of three sections:

1. General Metrics: Metrics on peaks (blacklisted peaks and peak widths) and fragments (duplication rate) of input epigenetic datasets 
2. Peak Overlap: Percentage and statistical significance of overlapping and non-overlapping peaks 
3. Functional Annotation: Functional annotation (ChromHMM, ChIPseeker and enrichment analysis) of peaks 

N.B. All functional analyses performed by EpiCompare uses annotations for human genome hg19. 
N.B. Peaks in blacklisted regions and non-standard chromosomes are removed from peak files before any analysis

# Installation 

To install `EpiCompare` use:

```R
if(!require("remotes")) install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("neurogenomics/EpiCompare")
```

# Usage 

Load package and example datasets.

```R
library(EpiCompare)
data("encode_H3K27ac") # example peakfile
data("CnT_H3K27ac") # example peakfile
data("CnR_H3K27ac") # example peakfile
data("hg19_blacklist") # example blacklist 
```

Run EpiCompare: 

```R
peaklist <- list(encode_H3K27ac, CnT_H3K27ac, CnR_H3K27ac) 
namelist <- c("encode", "CnT", "CnR")
EpiCompare(peakfiles = peaklist,
           names = namelist,
           blacklist = hg19_blacklist,
           reference = encode_H3K27ac,
           stat_plot = TRUE,
           chrmHMM_plot = TRUE,
           chipseeker_plot = TRUE,
           enrichment_plot = TRUE,
           save_output = TRUE,
           output_dir = "/path/to/output")
```

#### Mandatory Inputs 

These input parameters must be provided: 

* `peakfiles` : Peakfiles you want to analyse. The files must be in GRanges object. To convert BED files into 
GRanges, use `ChIPseeker::readPeakFile("/path/to/peak/file", as = "GRanges")`. If there are more than one peakfiles, the files must be listed using `list()`. 
* `namelist` : Names of peakfiles. If there are more than one, must be listed in the same order as peakfiles are listed using `c()`.
* `blacklist` : Peakfile as GRanges object specifying genomic regions that have anomalous and/or unstructured signals independent of the cell-line or experiment. For human genome hg19, use `data(hg19_blacklist)` stored in the package.

#### Optional Plots 

By default, these plots will not be included in the report unless set `TRUE`. 

* `stat_plot` : included only if a `reference` dataset is provided. The plot shows statistical significance (p/q-values) of sample peaks that are overlapping/non-overlapping with the `reference` dataset. 
* `chrmHMM_plot` : ChromHMM annotation of peaks. If a `reference` dataset is provided, ChromHMM annotation of overlapping and non-overlapping peaks with the `reference` is also included in the report. 
* `chipseeker_plot` : ChIPseeker annotation of peaks.
* `enrichment_plot` : KEGG pathway and GO enrichment analysis of peaks. 

#### Optional Inputs

* `picard_files` : A list of summary metrics output from Picard. If provided, metrics on fragments (e.g. mapped fragments and duplication rate) will be included in the report. Files must be in data.frame format and listed using `list()` and named using `names()`. To import Picard duplication metrics (.txt file) into R as data frame, use `picard <- read.table("/path/to/picard/output", header = TRUE, fill = TRUE)`.
* `reference` : Reference peak file used in `stat_plot` and `chrmHMM_plot`. File must be in GRanges object.  

#### Outputs 

`EpiCompare` outputs the following:

* HTML report: A summary of all analyses saved in specified `output_dir`
* EpiCompare_file: if `save_output=TRUE`, all plots generated by EpiCompare will be saved in EpiCompare_file directory also in specified `output_dir`
